      <p>I have over 13 years of experience in C# and .NET, and a keen interest in the latest technologies. My experience has provided me with excellent opportunities to build robust applications and services with global reach.</p>
      <p>In my free time I'm usually keeping fit in some way, at a gig, or curled up with a book a nice cup of tea.</p>
      <p>You can find some of my work in my <a href="/about">projects page</a>. And some more stuff <a href="/about">about me here.</a></p>
