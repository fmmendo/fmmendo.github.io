<!-- 
Hi, my name is Filipe and I’m a software engineer. I’m Portuguese, currently living in London, and working for [Paddle](http://www.paddle.com/).

I try to blog mostly about dev stuff, from projects I’m working on, to problems and solutions I find while coding, with the occasion plug for an app or two I might put out there.


When I’m not coding, I can be found behind a good book, enjoying a good movie, pretending I can shread on my guitar, travelling with friends, riding some waves or (stumbling down) some slopes, going to gigs, and occasionally at the theatre, having a burger, or saving the world in some videogame.

### Background
I am currently a developer at [NewDay](https://www.newday.co.uk/), working with .NET Core/.NET5 on Azure. I hold a [Masters in Computer Engineering](http://www.ua.pt/ensino/PageCourse.aspx?id=23&amp;p=4&amp;a=9) from the [University of Aveiro](http://www.ua.pt), in Portugal, where my love for programming began. I ended up writing my Masters’ dissertation on “Interaction with Large Displays in a Public Space via a Mobile Device” where I got to explore the world of Human-Computer Interaction and User Experience, and a bit of Computer Graphics on the side. The result is still in display in the university, and more [details](/app/2012/12/09/deti-interact/
) can be found in my [Projects](/apps) page. -->

💼  Currently a Senior Software Engineer at [NewDay](https://www.newday.co.uk/). Previously built an SDK and some microservices at [Paddle](https://www.paddle.com/), UWP apps at [UI Centric](https://www.uicentric.com/) and [Nodes](https://www.nodesagency.com/). You can find more details in my [resume](/resume) page (or [download](https://1drv.ms/b/s!And2bv7mGIgupaNy6z8P17b4gJgAaw?e=GG5VVY) it).

🎓  Obtained an [MSc in Computer Science](https://www.ua.pt/en/c/23/p) from the [University of Aveiro](https://www.ua.pt), in Portugal. My master’s thesis project invovled developing means of interaction with large public displays, and the code is [here](https://github.com/fmmendo/DetiInteract).

👨‍💻  I enjoy building things. A did quite a bit of UWP development for a while and some of that is available in my [Projects](/projects) page. More recently I have spent some time learning new things and some experiments can be found on [github](https://github.com/fmmendo).

💎  I am an avid reader and a regular at the movies. I also might have spent an hour too many in some videogames. A self-taught guitarist and a regular at rock gigs. Also theatre. I enjoy [travelling](http://www.fmendo.com/travel) and going to theme parks - cannot get enough of roller coasters. Average bodyboarder and passable skier. Love a good burger.

🏋️‍♂‍  I like keeping fit. I probably spend a lot more time than I should at my local crossfit box. I also frequently sign up to muddy obstacle course races. 

🌍  Born in Canterbury but lived in Portugal most of my life. Moved to London for work in 2012 with the intention of trying other countries over time but I'm still here.
