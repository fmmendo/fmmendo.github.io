💼  Currently a Senior Software Engineer at [NewDay](https://www.newday.co.uk/). Previously built an SDK and some microservices at [Paddle](https://www.paddle.com/), Windows apps at [UI Centric](https://www.uicentric.com/) and Android apps at [Nodes](https://www.nodesagency.com/). You can find more details in my [resume](/resume) page.

🎓  Obtained an [MSc in Computer Science](https://www.ua.pt/en/c/23/p) from the [University of Aveiro](https://www.ua.pt), in Portugal. My master’s thesis project invovled developing means of interaction with large public displays, and the (very old) code is in my [github](https://github.com/fmmendo/DetiInteract).

👨‍💻  I enjoy building things. A did quite a bit of UWP development for a while and some of that is available in my [Projects](/projects) page. I have since switched to more backend stuff but I still spend time learning new things. I've tinkered with React, Angular, and monogame and some experiments can be found on [github](https://github.com/fmmendo).

💎  I am an avid reader and a regular at the movies. I also might have spent an hour too many in some videogames. A self-taught guitarist and a regular at rock gigs. Also theatre. I enjoy travelling and going to theme parks - cannot get enough of roller coasters. Whenever I'm at the beach I try to sqeeze in some bodyboarding and I'll book a ski trip whenever possbile. Love a good burger.

🏋️‍♂‍  I like keeping fit. I probably spend a lot more time than I should at my local crossfit box. I enjoy challenging myself with a few spartan races and triathlons every once in a while. And I'm also out on my road bike or bouldering with friends.

🌍  Born in Canterbury, UK, but lived in Portugal most of my life. Moved to London for work in 2012 thinking I'd move around to other countries over time but I'm still enjoying it here.
