My name is Filipe Duarte and I’m software developer. I’m Portuguese, currently living
in London, and working for [Paddle](http://www.paddle.com/).

I try to blog mostly about dev stuff, from projects I’m working on, to problems and solutions I find while coding, with the occasion plug for an app or two I might put out there.

When I’m not coding, I’m usually found behind a good book, enjoying a good movie, pretending I can shread on my guitar, riding some waves or (stumbling down) some slopes, or saving the world in some videogame.

### Background
I am currently a developer at [Paddle](http://www.paddle.com/), working on the Windows SDK. I hold a [Masters in Computer Engineering](http://www.ua.pt/ensino/PageCourse.aspx?id=23&amp;p=4&amp;a=9) from the [University of Aveiro](http://www.ua.pt), in Portugal, where my love for programming began. I ended up writing my Masters’ dissertation on “Interaction with Large Displays in a Public Space via a Mobile Device” where I got to explore the world of Human-Computer Interaction and User Experience, and a bit of Computer Graphics on the side. The result is still in display in the university, and more [details](/app/2012/12/09/deti-interact/
) can be found in my [Projects](/apps) page.
