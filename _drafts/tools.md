# What I Use

_updated 2021_

## Editor & Terminal

- Most of my work centres around .NET development so [Visual Studio Community]() is the absolute beste, and therefore my IDE of choice.
- I also use [Visual Studio Code]() for everything else. It has become quite good for .Net Core work as well, though there are a few things where old Visual Studio still excells.
- Being on Windows, I use [Windows Terminal]() with [oh-my-posh]() and a custom theme for all my CLI needs, including jumping into WSL when needed.
- To speed up gething a machine ready to work, I have scripted most installations and configurations. It's a bit of an always changing script but I've got it all up in my [win-provision]() repo.

## VS Code Extensions

- formulahendry.dotnet (.NET Core Tools)
- formulahendry.dotnet-test-explorer (Test Explorer...)
- jchannon.csharpextensions ("new class")
- ms-dotnettools.csharp
- ms-dotnettools.vscode-dotnet-runtime
- GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github
- ryanluker.vscode-coverage-gutters
- urbanoanderson.vscode-coverlet
- ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl`
- PKief.material-icon-theme

Most of these are automatically installed with the [win-provision]() scripts I mentioned above.

## Other Tools and Apps

- [Winget](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli): Windows finally has a decent package manager.
- [Fiddler](): Great tool to look at (and _fiddle_ with) all your HTTP traffic.
- [WSL](): I rarely need to use linux, but now I don't have to dual boot.
- [Postman](): If you build or test APIs you'll be using this or a similar tool.
- [Microsoft To Do](): I use this to plan _everything_. I loosely follow some [GTD]() guidelines but also do my own thing.
- [Microsoft OneNote](): Anything that isn't a To Do list probably goes in here.
- [Linqpad](): When you need to test a bit of code, or parse some data and don't want to fire up Visual Studio and write all the required code.
- [WinDirStat](): Great tool to look at what's taking up space on your hard drive.

## Hardware Setup

- Currently using [15" Surface Book 2]() with a 512GB SSD and 16GB RAM and absolutely loving it. This was an upgrade from an old Surface Pro 3 (and to be honest, givent the extra portability of the Pro, in a future upgrade I just might return to the Pro line).
- My job also provided me with a Dell Latitute. Don't really know the details on it but it gets the job done. Should be upgraded soon.
- An old 24" Asus monitor ðŸ˜… (poor thing needs updating).
- A gorgeous 4K [Samsung M70A 32"](https://www.samsung.com/uk/monitors/business/smart-m7-32-inch-uhd-4k-ls32am700uuxen/) screen. It's massive, has some Smart TV elements and functions as a USB-C Hub.
- My keyboard is a [Glorious GMMK TKL White Ice]() with [Zilent V2]() switches. After months of indecision I finally pulled the trigger on the keyboard and replaced the Gateron browns with some lovely Zilents. Now _that's_ tactility.
- Still holding on to my trusty [Surface Designer Bluetooth Mouse](). Full size, yet small enough to travel with, and the batteries last ages.
- With the world switching to WFH, I finally got myself a [Fully Jarvis]() standing desk. Pricey but worth every penny.
- I got a pair of [Edifier R1700BT]() which are a fantastic set of speakers.
- For travelling or office* I have my trusty [Sony WH-H900N]() which provide excelent sound quality and noise cancellation at a reasonable price point. *(back when we were allowed to travel and had an office to go to ðŸ˜…)

<!-- ## Deprecated -->

- [Microsoft Display Dock]() a relic from the Windows Phone days. Replaced once I got my new screen.
