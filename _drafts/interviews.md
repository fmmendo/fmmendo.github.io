Boy, this year sucked! ðŸ˜…

This year was a bit of a write-off, but I did want to write down a few things.

# Take Home Tasks

The first thing I'm going to pick on (and judging from what I see and hear around the web, I'm not alone in this) is the take home task. Particularly the large ones, or when the recruiter says there's "no time limit", or to deliver it "within 1-2 weeks".

While these seem to be universally hated, they can be valuable if the task is properly designed, in which case it should take the applicant no more than a couple of hours to get it done. Unfortunately most of these tasks end up taking 8+ hours to get done and considering most people have a day job, a commute, and other responsibilities, we're talking about wasting at least a full week of free time (maybe even a chunk of the weekend).

The first task I just declined to do involved, as usual, building some

One role I interviewed for was going to be interfacing with two teams so, as I bonus, I was given not one but two(!) tasks to work on, one for each team. I actually started working on one of them before deciding it was just not worth my time.

Finally I applied for a company I had tried to interview about a year earlier (I failed the test at the time because I didn't want to invest that much time in it). I wanted to mention this because one of the criteria the task was evaluated on was "ability to go the extra mile", i.e. not only did they want a fully implemented e2e solution, properly architected, tested, and documented, I would be a good idea to put some _extra_ work in (such as a database, authentication, encryption, CI, analytics, performance metrics, etc) because other candidates will surely do so and naturally you need to stand out.

# Lack of Feedback

From my experience, sometimes you know you've just aced an interview - or completely botched it. But for most interviews you still want to hear some feedback, particularly in case of a rejection. Interviewers will typically accompany a rejection email with some constructive feedback but this time I had two curious situations:

One company had me do a codility test which in this particular case went fantasticly well (sidenote: I do enjoy these, even if sometimes I do get time-capped).They then followed up a few days later saying they wouldn't be progressing and that they couldn't provide any feedback. I thought that was odd. I'd expect, once your a couple of stages into the process to at least have some justification for it, just to give us some closure.

There was another role I failed on the final stage, and I was sent a nice apologetic email with the rejection and they offered to provide feedback should I want it. They could've just sent the feedback right there - like most other companies -, but moving on: I asked for feedback. Silence. I waited a couple of weeks and asked again. Nada.

Seriously, this shouldn't be that hard.

# Long Interview Processes

Another issue were long interview processes. I interviewed for a couple of roles with so many stages, that even if the whole thing was promptly scheduled the process would still take a lot of time. When you think of having 5 or 6 stages booked in 1-3 week intervals plus taking into account that most candidates will still like have a month's notice (at least), you end up having a 3+ month long process.

# Delays

Then I also came across either delays or just long periods of time between each interview phases. Some delays were unavoidable for the employer, one case had the team working to a deadline, so the review of the take home task was delayed, others were facing pandemic-related struggles of their own so the hiring processes had to be put on hold for a bit. No problem there, just worth mentioning.

But there are always a few that stand out. One company acknowledged my application and proceeded by letting me know they would not be moving forward rougly 2 months later. To be honest I had almost forgotten about them at that point. Another took 2 months to let me know I had passed my codility test, which was great news, except that by then I had already accepted an offer.

# Lack of Communication

This one is quite annoying. Of all the issues I discuss here this is the easiest one to address. I'll take an impersonal or automated rejection email over radio silence any day. Just please don't leave me hanging.

I'll usually look at the timings of my conversations with recruiters to figure out an appropiate time to ping them back from some updates, might be a couple of days or a couple of weeks. Sometimes it works, sometimes the silence continues.

This time around I had a company ask for a rather sizeable take home task (ugh, fine...), which I went and delivered, and then I waited. And waited. And pinged the recruiter. Nothing. Waited another week, and pinged the recruiter again. Still nothing. And again, and again nothing. Can't really say more than: _f\*ck them_.

# Personal Failures

I should again emphasize that I'm not exclusively blaming the employers. There were certainly a few scenarios where the failure was all mine.

We have all had days where we wake up and realize it's not going to be a particularly good day for coding. Even when we didn't have to worry about an ongoing pandemic ðŸ˜…. That happened at least a couple of times during my search last year. I also failed this one system design interview because I had a mental block and just couldn't visualize what I had to do.

There were also a couple of instances where my experience didn't quite align with what the role required, and other instances the role requirements changed during the interview process (maybe that one wasn't my fault...). And also some interviews where the impostor syndrome kicked in and my confidence plummeted.

# My Ideal Interview

Now, I do have some favourite "interview types", if you will. These won't suit everybody's tastes, naturally, and some of these vary depending on the type of role, seniority, function/responsibilities, etc.

### Short Coding test.

This could be one of those Codility-type tests, or a small take home task. And I mean small, like 2h, _maximum_.

### 2-4 back-to-back interviews

Probably somethign like 3-4 for a more senior role, and 1-2 for a junior role. This is where you do a more exhaustive tech assessment, pairing/cooperation, system design, team/culture fit. In a normal world I'd either be taking a half/full day off, so we might as well get it all done.
