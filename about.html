    <!-- Main Content -->

                <p>My name is Filipe Duarte and I’m software developer. I’m Portuguese, although born in the UK, and I am currently living in London, working for UI Centric. I try to blog mostly about developer stuff, from projects I’m working on, to problems and solutions I find while coding (which hopefully might help others), with the occasion plug for an app or two I might put out there.</p>

				<p>I’m a Microsoft enthusiast whether we’re talking about tech, software, dev stuff, or research, and it would be a huge achievement for me if one day I got to work there, in the meantime I’m learning as much as I can, and working with a few interesting companies and their exciting projects.</p>
                <p>When I’m not coding, I’m usually found behind a good book, enjoying a good movie, shredding on my guitar, riding some waves or some slopes (depending on the season), or saving the world in some videogame.</p>
            
			<h3>Background</h3>
			<p>I am currently a developer at <a title="UI Centric" href="http://uicentric.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">UI Centric</span></span></a>, building awesome Universal Apps for windows and windows phone.</p>
			<p>I hold a <a title="Course Structure" href="http://www.ua.pt/ensino/PageCourse.aspx?id=23&amp;p=4&amp;a=9"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Masters in Computer Engineering</span></span></a> from the <a title="Universidade de Aveiro" href="http://www.ua.pt"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">University of Aveiro</span></span></a>, in Portugal, where my love for programming began. I ended up writing my Masters’ dissertation on “Interaction with large displays in a public space via a mobile device” where I did a lot of Human-Computer Interaction and User Experience work, along with a bit of Computer Graphics on the side. The result is still in display in the university, and more <a title="DETI Interact" href="http://fmendo.com/deti-interact"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">details</span></span></a> are available in my <a title="Projects" href="http://fmendo.com/projects"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Projects</span></span></a> page. While in university I was also a Volunteer Student in the organization of an HCI conference in my University: <a title="interaccao 2010" href="http://www3.ca.ua.pt/interaccao2010/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Interacção 2010</span></span></a>.</p>
